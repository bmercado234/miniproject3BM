<!--- (10/10 points) There should be a README.md file in your project that explains what 
your project is, how to install the pip requirements, and how to execute the program. 
Please use the GitHub flavor of Markdown. Be thorough on the explanations. 
You will need to explain the steps of initializing the database and then how to run the 
development server for your project. --->
